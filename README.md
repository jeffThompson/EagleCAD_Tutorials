EagleCAD Tutorials
==================

A set of tutorials for learning EagleCAD and circuit design.

####DRU FILE
Also included is a design rule set called 'BasicHandEtching.dru', designed for home PCB etching using laser printed overhead transparencies and ferric chloride. To install this file, download it and place it in:

    Applications > Eagle > dru

####PCB ETCHING IMAGE
This repository also includes a file called 'PCB_EtchingImage.png' - this file has undergone several transformations after export from Eagle:
1. Colors inverted - I use a MG Chemicals 600 series boards which are positive sensitized. Areas that are white are exposed and etched away, so the image from Eagle must be inverted.
2. The image is flipped - this means that when printed on overhead transparency film the printed image will be face-down, ensuring no light leaks under the printed image.
